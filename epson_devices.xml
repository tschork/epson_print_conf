			If you could not purchase a key right now you can use the keyword <b>trial</b> as one time reset key.<br>
			That will set all counters to 80% from the maximum (<b>but it will overflow again soon</b>).]]>

			<![CDATA[
			Communication errors almost always appear for one of the following reasons:<br><br>
			<UL>
				<LI>USB cable is of bad quality or USB port is damaged.</LI>
				<LI>Other applications or printing spooler try to communicate with the device.</LI>

			<UL>
				<LI>Replace USB cable and USB port. This step is mandatory.</LI>
				<LI>After the USB cable has been replaced, shutdown the printer and restart the PC.</LI>
				<LI>Shutdown all processes AND services that can potentially communicate with the printer.</LI>
				<LI>Shutdown epson/canon services and processes either manually or via this application.</LI>
				<LI>In order to do this via WICReset you need to start the application as administrator then
				select in the main menu on top <b>support >> disable processes</b> and follow instructions.</LI>
				<LI>Shutdown any 3-rd party printing software.</LI>

			<header>What to do with the fatal error?</header>
			<answer>
			<![CDATA[
			Fatal errors are unrelated to the waste counters and impossible to reset by software,
			they usualy indicate some mechanical or electrical malfunction.
			Visually printer notifies about the fatal error by ink and paper LED's blinking <b>simultaniously</b>.
			In order to find more information about your specific error first click `report` button in the main interface
			and read description of the last fatal error code that will contain name of the problem and list of possible causes
			(this feature is not available for some older models).
			Then you need to either bring the printer to the service center or tyr to fix it manually using service manual.
			More information can be found here:<br><br>

			<header>How to reset ink out error or to fix unrecognized cartridges?</header>
			<answer>
			<![CDATA[
			<UL>
				<LI>For L100/L200/L800 (and <b>only</b> for them) you can reset ink levels for free from the main interface.</LI>
				<LI>For other printers from the L series you can reset ink levels from printer's panel (see user manual for details).</LI>
				<LI>For other series it is impossible to do by software.</LI>
				<LI>If printer shows that cartridges are <b>empty</b> then you need to either replace them with the new ones,
				reset them according to the manufacturer's instruction if you are using refillable third party cartridges
				or install chipless firmware if one is available (<a href = www.chiplesssolutions.com>see here</a>).</LI>
				<LI>If printer shows that cartridges are <b>unrecognized</b> or <b>missing</b> then you need to make sure that
				ink cartridge chips are not damaged and clean, printhead contacts are intact and there are good contact between the two.</LI>
				<LI>Sometimes Epson also blocks third party cartridges with firmware update in which case firmware downgrade may help,
				but first make sure that the problem is indeed with firmware, in this case printer must have latest firmware version,
				original cartridges must still work and all third party cartridges must be unrecognizable
				(even if one them is still recognized then the issue is with something else).</LI>

			<![CDATA[
			Ошибки связи чаще всего возникают по следующим причинам:<br><br>
			<UL>
				<LI>USB кабель плохого качества или поврежден USB порт.</LI>
				<LI>Другие приложения или подсистема печати пытаются взаимодействовать с принтером.</LI>

			<header>Что делать в случае критической ошибки?</header>
			<answer>
			<![CDATA[
			Критические ошибки не связаны с отработкой и не могут быть справлены программно,
			обычно они указывают на механическую неполадку или проблемы с электроникой.
			Визуально принтер показывает ошибку <b>одновременным</b> миганием индикаторов краски и бумаги.
			Чтобы получить больше информации о вашей специфической ошибке нажмите кнопку `отчет` в основном интерфейсе
			и прочитайте описание последней критической ошибки содержащее код ошибки, проблему и список возможных причин
			(данная функция недоступна для некоторых старых моделей).
			После этого вам нужно либо отнести принтер в сервисный центр, либо исправить ошибку вручную используя сервисный мануал.

			<header>Как исправить ошибку чернил и нераспознанные картриджи?</header>
			<answer>
			<![CDATA[
			<UL>
				<LI>Для L100/L200/L800 (и <b>только</b> для них) доступен бесплатный сброс уровней чернил в основном интерфейсе.</LI>
				<LI>Для остальных принтеров L серии урочень чернил можно сбросить с панели принтера (смотрите в мануале пользователя).</LI>
				<LI>Для остальных серий сбросить уровень чернил программно невозможно.</LI>
				<LI>Если принтер показывет, что картриджи <b>пустые</b> необходимо либо заменить их на новые,
				либо сбросить согласно инструкции производителя (если используются перезаправяемые сторонние картриджи).
				Так же для некоторых моделей доступна бесчиповая прошивка (<a href = www.chiplesssolutions.com>смотрите здесь</a>).</LI>
				<LI>Если принтер показывает, что картриджи <b>нераспознаны</b> или <b>отсутствуют</b> необходимо удостоверится,
				что чипы на картриджах чистые и не повреждены, а так же, что контакты на голове целы и плотно прилегают к чипам.</LI>
				<LI>Иногда Epson блокирует сторонние картриджи с обновлением прошивки и в таком случае может помочь ее понижени,
				однако прежде чем выполнять понижение убедитесь, что проблема действительно в прошивки,
				в этом случае принтер должен иметь последнюю версию прошивки,
				оригинальные картриджи должны распознаваться и все сторонные картриджи должны быть нераспознаны
				(если хотя бы один сторонний картридж распознается, то проблема в чем-то другом).</LI>
